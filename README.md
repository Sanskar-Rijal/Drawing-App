## Drawing app is  application made for android
It's just like Ms paint but with limited colors.I added color pallete as well,but loved it with limited colors so i removed it.
> Just use any image from gallery,it will be transparent and after finishing remove it.

> Save the file in png format at Android/data/com.example.paintinandroid

> Their is a share bottom but since it's stored as cache in android directory, Android blocks it from sharing 

> You can only view your saved files by connecting it to pc

**To install it on your computer just go to github desktop,clone it and open android studio then just open the project**
